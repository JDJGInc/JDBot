If you decide to Contribute
You must check the pull requests before you try to suggest something
You may check Projects to see if there is something you can contribute.
You should attempt to pick the coding style I have.
You should also try to pick something I agree with.
if you aren't sure you can join: JDJG Inc. Official#3493
I will start making sure pylance at some point is ran on my code.
Anyway, Please Make Pull Requests that seem to fit, if you have an questions you can join my discord which is linked in my readme.

Black is what we use to check the code, please make sure it's valid.
If you Contributed succesfully, and it's something I agree to credit you with, you will be added to the credits command at one point.
Please don't make random pull requests to just get featured.

You should use Pylance to make sure your code is clean and well
Or you can use

```bash
black -l120 .
```

formatted.
I will make a way to check it in the future.
Thank You,
JDJG
